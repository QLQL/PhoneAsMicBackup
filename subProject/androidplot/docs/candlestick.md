# Candlestick Charts
Candlestick charts are implemented in Androidplot as a custom XYSeries type.  At the moment, documentation
is pretty light.  For now, [see this doc on usage](http://androidplot.com/docs/candlestick-charts/)
or check out the DemoApp's [candlestick example source](../demoapp/src/main/java/com/androidplot/demos/CandlestickChartActivity.java).
